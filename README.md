### Project Description
The purpose of this project is to create a website that allows users to manipulate a grid system. We
have to use JavaScript and DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation techniques in order to
implement the functionality of the website. The user should be able to add or remove rows and
columns, select a color, and color individual cells by clicking on the cell, color all uncolored cells with
the selected color, color all cells with the selected color, and clear all cells' color and restore all cells to
their initial color.
